# /lib

This is the default README generated by PlatformIO, but contains an explaination of how PlatformIO compiles and links code inside the `lib` folder. Much of our code is contained here because it is the most convenient spot to place code that needs to be compiled.

This directory is intended for project specific (private) libraries.
PlatformIO will compile them to static libraries and link into executable file.

The source code of each library should be placed in a an own separate directory
("lib/your_library_name/[here are source files]").

For example, see a structure of the following two libraries `Foo` and `Bar`:

|--lib
| |
| |--Bar
| | |--docs
| | |--examples
| | |--src
| | |- Bar.c
| | |- Bar.h
| | |- library.json (optional, custom build options, etc) ([more info](https://docs.platformio.org/page/librarymanager/config.html))
| |
| |--Foo
| | |- Foo.c
| | |- Foo.h
| |
| |- README --> THIS FILE
|
|- platformio.ini
|--src
|- main.c

and a contents of `src/main.c`:

```
#include <Foo.h>
#include <Bar.h>

int main (void)
{
  ...
}

```

PlatformIO Library Dependency Finder will find automatically dependent
libraries scanning project source files.
